# Paint Bucket Simulation using Flood Fill

> Made to fill the requirements of IF2211

This project was made to test the use of flood fill algorithms for making paint bucket tool simulation. Paint bucket is a tool that is highly available on all generic image processing softwares (even Microsoft Paint has it).
